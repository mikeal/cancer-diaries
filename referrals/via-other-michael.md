A transcript from my chat with my other Michael, who also has
stage 4 CRC.

**tl;dr**

* Yes, City of Hope is The Place. They are everything under one
  roof.
* Look into getting onto a trial of onvansertib, which has to be
  admitted *prior* to starting chemotherapy, so it's a narrow
  window, like, probably "right now".
* https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06106308?term=NCT06106308&rank=1
