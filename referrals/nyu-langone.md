I saw the post today about the primary being in the colon. My late father was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic lung cancer in his brain in 2005.

When he was diagnosed he was given three months to live. He went on to live for 11 years.

## NYU Langone

The NYU Langone hospital system – specifically [Dr. Abe Chachoua][1] – were instrumental to him winning the fight for so long. My research began here and I found a short list of Gastrointestinal Oncologists that may be of interest:

* [Kristen Spencer, D.O.][2] – Director of Phase 1 Trials which stood out to me because it is focused on patients with advanced metastatic cancers 
* [Nina Beri, MD][3] – Principal Investigator on a number of clinical trials (39) of related advanced cancers 
* [Jennifer Chuy, MD][4] – similar research publications (16) regarding patients with advanced cancers & solid tumors but more sub investigator roles than principal investigator
* Full list of oncologists – [the search here][5] is based on distance to 10016 because the cancer center that saved my dad's life is around the corner from where he lived ## Additional research / links

## Other research

It's ~10pm and I've already gotten a number of links of suggestions from other folks I know who have had to build the pattern matching needed to fight cancer. 

* _"This took place in November, but take a look at the faculty list":_ [8th Annual Advances in Colorectal Oncology: Evolving Trends in Evidence-Based Practice][6]
* _"Closer to home":_ [Alan P. Venook, MD, UCSF][7]

I will add more here as I find it. Until then: believe in your fight and anything is possible. Truly.

For my father, his belief that "this was not his time" was as powerful as the therapies that helped stay his cancer for all that time.

May you find that same strength to fight to win ❤️
